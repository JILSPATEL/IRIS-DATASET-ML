# Iris Dataset Clustering

This repository contains code and resources for performing clustering analysis on the famous Iris dataset. Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups similar data points together. In this project, we explore the Iris dataset and apply clustering algorithms to find patterns and groupings within the data.

## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate how clustering algorithms can be applied to the Iris dataset for pattern discovery. By grouping similar instances of iris flowers, we can gain insights into the relationships between different species and their attributes.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and statistics. It includes measurements of four features for three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The features are sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

- **Dataset:** [Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abhi8901/iris-classification-finding-optimal-no-clusters/input)
